    "# The Mystery of Boreas the Penguin\n",
    "\n",
    "Greetings, NSF SOARS adventurers! As you embark on your scientific journey with us this summer, we have an urgent mystery that only the sharpest minds can solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boreas the Penguin, our fearless guide through the world of atmospheric science, has vanished! His last known whereabouts remain a mystery, and we need your expertise to track him down. But fear not—history, science, and the forces of nature have left behind a clue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, UCAR president Tony Busalacchi reported that Boreas was considering a vacation, and was likely looking for a very cold place to be. Maybe this will be helpful?\n",
    "\n",

    "A powerful [derecho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derecho) recently tore through Colorado, its winds howling across the Flatirons just as they have for millennia. In its wake, something peculiar was left at the doorstep of the NSF NCAR Mesa Lab—a place that has stood as a beacon of atmospheric discovery since its founding in 1960 by the NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). There, amidst the swirling dust, our team found a lanyard with a USB thumb drive, its presence as puzzling as a sudden mountain wave cloud over the Front Range.\n",
    "\n",
    "Could this be the key to finding Boreas? The very same winds that helped NSF NCAR's earliest scientists unlock the mysteries of turbulence, climate modeling, and severe storms may have also carried a critical clue to Boreas' location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our diligent NSF [NCAR Research Information Technology (NRIT)](https://sundog.ucar.edu/page/9124?SearchId=1345861) team has ensured the drive is safe to examine, but the contents remain a mystery. What secrets does it hold? Is it a message? A puzzle? A map guiding us to Boreas?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to analyze the data to find Boreas and follow the scientific trail—just as NSF NCAR's researchers have done for decades to advance our understanding of the atmosphere. From the pioneering work in numerical weather prediction to today's cutting-edge research in climate science, air quality, and extreme weather, you now stand in the footsteps of discovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are you ready to take on the challenge? Boreas is counting on you!\n",
    "Let the adventure begin!"
